# apartment_scraper

### The Challenge:
- Scrape the first 500 items (title, image url) from https://www.sreality.cz/en (flats, sell) and save it in the Postgresql database. 
- Implement a simple HTTP server (or use Nginx) and show these 500 items on a nice page (with pagination) which will use your own design and put everything to single docker-compose command
- The solution must be written in Typescript & React.
